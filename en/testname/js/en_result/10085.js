You survive by thinking,
not reacting.

You stay calm under pressure
and constantly analyze
your surroundings.
In the Squid Game,
you don’t rely on luck —
you rely on foresight.
Your strength is patience,
but beware:
overthinking can slow you down
when speed matters most.

You trust your gut
more than any plan.
While others hesitate,
you move.
This makes you unpredictable

luck plays a bigger role
