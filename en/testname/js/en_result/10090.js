You pride yourself on “just telling the truth.”
And yes — you *are* honest.
Painfully so.

The problem?
You forget that honesty without timing,
tact, or empathy
still hurts.

People admire your backbone,
but they often brace themselves
before asking what you think.

You use humor as a shield.
Sarcasm, teasing, little comments
that *technically* aren’t insults.

Except… everyone feels it.

You avoid direct conflict,
but your jokes leave dents.
People laugh — then wonder
if you actually meant it.

When things get uncomfortable,
you fade out.

No explanation.
No closure.
Just vibes… and silence.

To you, it’s self-protection.
To others, it’s confusing and hurtful.
People never know where they stand —
and that uncertainty lingers.

You don’t mean to dominate the room —
but you do.

Stories get redirected.
Attention shifts.
Your presence fills all available space.

Friends like you,
but sometimes feel smaller around you.
You shine so bright
you forget to dim it for others.
