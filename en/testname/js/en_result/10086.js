Let’s be real—you’ve got "first victim" energy.

You panicked, you screamed,
and the Upside Down heard you loud and clear.

You didn't even get to see the monster's face
before you became its midnight snack.

You have some survival instincts,
but you're too logical for a world that defies logic.

You tried to hide,
but the psychological toll of the vines got to you.

You’re the character fans feel

You lasted long enough to find a weapon
and kill a few vines.

You’re brave—maybe a little too brave.

You’d probably die in the season finale

they’re trapped in there with you.

You’ve got the perfect mix of paranoia,
